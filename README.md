# Fraction
Task 3 part b - CPP Course
## The task:
Implemention of class named Ftaction.cpp that represents a fraction of two integers.</div>
Overload the following operators for this class:</div>

    The + operator to add two fractions and return their sum as another fraction in reduced form.
    The - operator to subtract two fractions and return their difference as another fraction in reduced form.
    The * operator to multiply two fractions and return their product as another fraction in reduced form.
    The / operator to divide two fractions and return their quotient as another fraction in reduced form.
    The == operator to compare two fractions for equality and return true or false.
    All comparison operations (>,<,>=,<=)
    The ++ and -- operator that adds (or substracts) 1 to the fraction. implement both pre and post fix.
    The << operator to print a fraction to an output stream in the format “numerator/denominator”.
    The >> operator to read a fraction from an input stream by taking two integers as input.
    All operators should work on both sides on fractions and floats type variables. on a float var you need use up to 3 digits beyond the desimal point for acuracy.
